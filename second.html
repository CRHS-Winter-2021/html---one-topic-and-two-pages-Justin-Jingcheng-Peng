    <p>We bring over 50 years of experience to the work that we do. Our story began in 1963 when a group of secondary school teachers developed the first mathematics contest in Ontario. From that spark, the CEMC has grown into one of Canada’s foremost authorities on mathematics and computer science for young people. We bring over 50 years of experience to the work that we do.
